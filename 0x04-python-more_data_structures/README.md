# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

0- Function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix. matrix is a 2 dimensional array. Returns a new matrix: Same size as matrix; Each value should be the square of the value of the input

1- Function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list. my_list is the initial list; search is the element to replace in the list; replace is the new element

2- Function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).

3- Function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.

4- Function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.

5- Function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

6- Function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys. Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order; Only sort keys of the first level (don’t sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary); Dictionary values can have any type

7- Function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary. key argument will be always a string
value argument will be any type; If a key exists in the dictionary, the value will be replaced; If a key doesn’t exist in the dictionary, it will be created

8- Function that deletes a key in a dictionary. key argument will be always a string; If a key doesn’t exist, the dictionary won’t change

9- Function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2. Returns a new dictionary

10- Function that returns a key with the biggest integer value. If no score found, return None

11- Function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops. Returns a new list: Same length as my_list; Each value should be multiplied by number; Initial list should not be modified

12- Function def roman_to_int(roman_string): that converts a Roman numeral to an integer. If the roman_string is not a string or None, return 0

100- Function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple (<score>, <weight>). Returns 0 if the list is empty

101- Function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map. matrix is a 2 dimensional array; Returns a new matrix: Same size as matrix; Each value should be the square of the value of the input

102- Function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary. If the value doesn’t exist, the dictionary won’t change; All keys having the searched value have to be deleted

103- Two C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes objects.
