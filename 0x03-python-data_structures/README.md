# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

0- Function that prints all integers of a list.

1- Function that retrieves an element from a list like in C. If idx is negative, the function should return None
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None

2- Function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C). 
If idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list

3- Function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

4- Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C). 
If idx is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return a copy of the original list

5- Function that removes all characters c and C from a string. The function should return the new string

6- Function that prints a matrix of integers.

7- Function that adds 2 tuples. Returns a tuple with 2 integers: The first element should be the addition of the first element of each argument; The second element should be the addition of the second element of each argument
If a tuple is smaller than 2, use the value 0 for each missing integer
If a tuple is bigger than 2, use only the first 2 integers

8- Function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character. If the sentence is empty, the first character should be equal to None

9- Function that finds the biggest integer of a list. If the list is empty, return None

10- Function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list. Return a new list with True or False, depending on whether the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2
The new list should have the same size as the original list

11- Function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list. If idx is negative or out of range, nothing change (returns the same list)

12- Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b

13- Function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome. Return: 0 if it is not a palindrome, 1 if it is a palindrome; An empty list is considered a palindrome

14- Function that prints some basic info about Python lists.
